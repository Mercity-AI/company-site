Embodied AI systems that can interact with the physical world require more than just visual understanding. This research explores the integration of multiple sensory modalities for robust robotic manipulation.

## The Sensory Gap

Current robotic systems primarily rely on vision, but human manipulation is fundamentally multimodal. Consider grasping a delicate object—we use:

- **Vision** to locate and plan approach
- **Proprioception** to guide arm movement
- **Tactile sensing** to detect contact and adjust grip force

## Our Multimodal Architecture

We developed a unified transformer architecture that processes:

1. RGB-D visual streams (camera)
2. Force/torque sensor data
3. Tactile array readings
4. Joint position encodings

All modalities are tokenized and processed through cross-attention layers, allowing the model to learn natural correspondences.

## Key Findings

Our experiments on manipulation tasks show:

- **67% improvement** in handling fragile objects
- **45% better** performance in occluded scenarios
- **Near-human** dexterity on precision assembly tasks

## Real-World Deployment

The system has been deployed in a factory setting for delicate electronic component assembly, demonstrating:

- Reduced breakage rates by 80%
- Adaptation to new objects with minimal fine-tuning
- Graceful degradation when sensors fail

## Future Work

We're now exploring the integration of auditory feedback for tasks where sound provides important information (e.g., detecting loose screws, liquid pouring).
