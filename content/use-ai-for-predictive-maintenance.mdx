This "run-to-failure" approach often leads to unexpected downtime and costly repairs. Historically, reactive maintenance was the standard practice before the development of more structured strategies like preventive maintenance. Without anticipating or preventing issues, equipment was simply repaired or replaced after failure, which could cause significant disruptions, particularly in critical operations.</p><p>As industries grew and equipment complexity increased, the limitations of reactive maintenance became apparent, paving the way for preventive maintenance. This strategy introduced scheduled upkeep to mitigate unexpected failures, thus improving reliability and extending asset life.</p><h3 id="anomaly-detection">Anomaly Detection</h3><p>Anomaly detection in predictive maintenance identifies irregularities in real-time equipment data, enabling early intervention before issues escalate. Techniques for anomaly detection include statistical analysis, time series analysis, and pattern recognition, utilizing both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. For instance, statistical approaches such as Z-score analysis flag unusual deviations in sensor readings, while time series models like ARIMA and deep learning architectures like LSTM networks are valuable for detecting complex temporal patterns in machine data. Pattern analysis further examines operational sequences, identifying deviations that may signal mechanical wear or impending faults.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image" style="max-width:1600pxpx"><div><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://blog-cdn.mercity.ai/blog/use-ai-for-predictive-maintenance/67955600e282f9bf5eb6bbf3_AD_4nXcukiZJe3x3Rp0MCzsx9F7nEmcCqt2JSzTE1J3J-9c4c2ed_sTvpro6YYBMdsaModyTl9ugyJWoRaqjuOdQpEsnFyzJByBClbitny98lAO3v5mgV7nuekhGy2uR0ltq1d6-vbGb9A.png"/></div></figure><p>Here’s an example graph showing vibration intensity over time, with red markers indicating anomaly points.

Sensors capture key parameters like vibration, temperature, pressure, and acoustic signals, which are continuously analyzed to detect wear or deterioration. When these readings indicate a decline in performance, CBM triggers maintenance, minimizing downtime and extending equipment lifespan. Unlike preventive maintenance, which operates on set schedules, CBM responds to the actual health of equipment, optimizing resource use and reducing unnecessary interventions.</p><p>CBM employs several survival analysis algorithms to predict equipment failure and better understand maintenance timing:</p><h4 id="kaplan-meier-survival-analysis">Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis</h4><p>The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is a non-parametric method used to estimate the probability of equipment survival over time. This model helps maintenance teams assess the likelihood of equipment operating without failure over specific periods, making it particularly useful for planning maintenance activities based on potential failure points in the equipment's life cycle.</p><p>Consider an example scenario, a company monitors the operational lifespan of its instruments, tracking the number of days each instrument remains operational before either failing or continuing beyond the observation period. The sample data includes operational days [120, 200, 95, 150, 240, 180, 300, 210, 130, 275] and corresponding failure events [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], where 1 indicates a failure and 0 represents censoring (the instrument continued functioning).</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image" style="max-width:846pxpx"><div><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://blog-cdn.mercity.ai/blog/use-ai-for-predictive-maintenance/679555fff45812ba0d4eaa17_AD_4nXd5gt2poEFaZTP7LGia8MfmK_4Vx4DUnxpeDgF-CdYN3X_HJQviab4qIRrkdyb-BW5hm-fh-M88zApnQb49Z26dnw_Y0kq_9_ZOEfYFykqrrOhRrvtLNGzfJXwfjFvzm2r_McS8Nw.png"/></div></figure><p>The Kaplan-Meier survival curve generated from this data illustrates the probability of instrument survival over time. The curve shows a steep decline in survival probability after around 100 operational days. At approximately 120 days, about 90% of the instruments are still operational, but this probability sharply declines between 100 and 200 days, reaching around 60% by 200 days. Beyond 200 days, the survival probability drops further, approaching zero by around 275 days, suggesting that most instruments are expected to fail within this timeframe.</p><h5 id="strategic-insights">Strategic Insights</h5><p>Based on this analysis, the company can take several proactive steps:</p><ol role="list"><li>Schedule preventive maintenance activities around the 100-day mark to address potential failures before they become critical.</li><li>Allocate budget for replacement or repair costs as instruments are likely to require attention beyond 200 operational days.</li><li>Inform end-users and stakeholders about expected equipment performance over time to set realistic expectations for the operational lifespan of the instruments.</li></ol><h4 id="cox-proportional-hazards-model">Cox Proportional Hazards Model</h4><p>The Cox Proportional Hazards Model is a statistical technique widely used in predictive maintenance to evaluate how different conditions impact equipment failure over time. Unlike the Kaplan-Meier method, which focuses on estimating survival probability for a single variable, the Cox model accommodates multiple factors, making it particularly suitable for condition-based maintenance (CBM). This model can incorporate variables such as temperature, vibration level, and operation frequency, providing a nuanced understanding of how each factor affects the likelihood of equipment failure.</p><p>Let’s assume a company has a dataset with specific values collected from machinery in an industrial setting. Below is a sample dataset with 10 entries representing machine conditions and their relationship to time-to-failure events.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image" style="max-width:1410pxpx"><div><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://blog-cdn.mercity.ai/blog/use-ai-for-predictive-maintenance/679555ff9cc3c0bf31c173c7_AD_4nXf-wWmmGm1ZEQ1glCoHrzftrGhdXc2iJXNwZ4rdGwAKJIgIILUxhhlUBVLKljAXLRoNArKZYHn0vjAKEHMTcb3kAR_Mjg9iZ0d5qd7erBNFfKuEW6ZORLaiF16dtD4bp6Ja1CcBbw.png"/></div></figure><p>Using this dataset, the Cox Proportional Hazards Model was applied to examine the impact of temperature, vibration level, and operation frequency on equipment failure risk.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image" style="max-width:1600pxpx"><div><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://blog-cdn.mercity.ai/blog/use-ai-for-predictive-maintenance/679556003d6035bcb072016b_AD_4nXd1pMA9BHOHEtY0tLtmmWD-MqBfKZhX_bUa_tVzhidlCCkfoaHqxA3niyemX94Ew2GkdXqUBJzU6qbmKZAz8fjjavZjVB6X1VWB4UUuIm437CfML-DG7jiEA7zcMuaCVbvhFbFpWg.png"/></div></figure><ol role="list"><li><strong>Coef (Coefficient):<br/></strong>Represents the change in the log hazard ratio for each unit increase in a covariate.

Sensors collect real-time data on parameters such as <em>temperature, vibration, and operational frequency</em>, which are then analyzed by AI algorithms to identify patterns and anomalies. These insights help forecast potential issues and schedule maintenance only when needed, reducing unplanned downtime and optimizing costs. Over time, AI models become more accurate by learning from historical data, enhancing reliability and efficiency across operations.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image" style="max-width:1600pxpx"><div><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://blog-cdn.mercity.ai/blog/use-ai-for-predictive-maintenance/679555ff9cf5e7cf020c5508_AD_4nXc-UfHZOD4dVqkgAyv6VYJjfFL56NGKr0EEahyg2ICjuEMSJILd4CzEpVjykvg8q9E4sc0JhkGBdOxUjPcb6onoylwpTjHSfZjDq-YaC506hx4GJT7M19ljeoYUCXBnle4X-SPS.png"/></div></figure><h3 id="data-collection-and-storage">Data Collection and Storage</h3><p>The process begins with collecting data from various sources, including IoT sensors, operational logs, and historical maintenance records from the equipment manufacturer. This data encompasses crucial parameters like temperature, vibration, rotational speed, and more, which are pivotal for predictive maintenance. For this example, we'll utilize data from a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stephanmatzka/predictive-maintenance-dataset-ai4i-2020/code?datasetId=2609801&amp;sortBy=voteCount">Kaggle dataset</a> to illustrate the process of gathering and storing data effectively.</p><div class="w-embed"><pre>

</pre></div><p>For this example, we'll utilize a synthetic dataset modeled after an existing milling machine, consisting of 10,000 data points with 14 features. Here are the key attributes of the dataset:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>UID:</strong> Unique identifier for each data point (1 to 10,000).<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Product ID:</strong> Combines product quality (L, M, H for Low, Medium, High) with a serial number.

On the other hand, the Random Forest Classifier provides robust classification predictions, making it well-suited for binary outcomes such as predicting whether a machine will fail or not. By combining insights from both approaches, predictive maintenance models can gain a deeper understanding of machine failure risks and optimize maintenance schedules, ultimately improving operational efficiency and reducing downtime.</p><h2 id="optimize-your-equipment-with-ai-powered-predictive-maintenance">Optimize Your Equipment with AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance!</h2><p>Ready to reduce downtime, cut maintenance costs, and boost operational efficiency?
