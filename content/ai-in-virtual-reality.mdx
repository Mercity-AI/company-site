<div class="rich-text w-richtext"><p>Blending artificial intelligence (AI) in virtual reality (VR) is changing how we interact with the world. AI can create more realistic and immersive VR experiences by generating 3D models, textures, and scenes. It can track and interact in VR by understanding the user's movements and facial expressions. Businesses can use this technology in training, customer service, and market research. Early adopters of AI-powered VR will be well-prepared to leverage this emerging technology.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss how artificial intelligence is improving virtual reality. It will help you understand the use of this next-level technology in your business.</p><h2 id="how-ai-can-be-used-in-vr">How AI Can Be Used In VR?</h2><p>Utilizing the below-mentioned techniques within VR environments has led to substantive outcomes. These technologies collectively enhance human-computer interactions, elevate visual fidelity, and improve object recognition accuracy. The intersection of AI and VR is reshaping how we experience and interact within virtual spaces, opening doors to a new era of immersive possibilities and practical applications.</p><h3 id="natural-language-interaction-in-vr">Natural Language Interaction in VR</h3><p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270337753_Development_of_an_Intelligent_Virtual_Environment_for_Augmenting_Natural_Language_Processing_in_Virtual_Reality_Systems">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</a> helps computers to understand human language. It can be integrated with VR using five components: a text parser, a rule base, an NLP to VR interface, a library of CAD (Computer Aided Design) models in ASCII formats, and a renderer. The text parser first receives the input from the user. It then breaks the input into parts and extracts relevant information from it. It would then generate a <strong>rule base</strong>, a set of rules that maintain the actions the renderer can perform. The NLP to VR interface fetches the required object from the library. It directs the extracted details and the rule base to the renderer. The renderer displays the model in the VR environment.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image" style="max-width:1158pxpx"><div><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/640f56f76d313bbe39631bfd/64dd147ba03216dc0e22bda3_iFIib04xG6y50LMjnAW0Sp8FY3uyRzwKXMWnbeREyH0_hrJVeBcIltva2XEQI8xbUog6mP__S0oY5VZX71Bd0h8NqhAJlqBaVaMVOxEM49GUlQh_3scc-id8ZQg0_fhD5BC_a1CTpgWL2zXAkcJCx6o.jpeg"/></div></figure><p>NLP techniques can assist voice-activated navigation, a more immersive and natural way to interact with VR environments.

It is a powerful tool to create VR experiences that are more immersive and realistic. NeRF uses a neural network to learn the relationship between the 3D position of a point in space and the color of the light reflected from that point. This relationship is called a radiance field. The neural network is trained on a dataset of images taken from different viewpoints of the object. It then generates a 3D model of the object by taking a ray from the viewer's eye and tracing it through the radiance field. Then the neural network determines the color of the light reflected from the object.

The diffusion model has three main components: the <strong>image encoder</strong>, the <strong>image information creator</strong> and an <strong>autoencoder decoder</strong>. The image encoder compresses the input image into a latent representation. This latent representation is a lower-dimensional representation of the image that contains the most important information about the image. The image information creator takes the latent representation from the image encoder and generates a sequence of numbers for pixels in the image. The autoencoder decoder takes the information from the image information creator and reconstructs the original image. The autoencoder decoder is trained to minimize the difference between the reconstructed image and the original image.</p><p>To generate images,a random latent matrix is generated. Smaller the latent space faster the image generation process. The noise predictor estimates the noise in the latent matrix. The estimated noise is subtracted from the latent matrix. This process is repeated for multiple steps. With each step, some noise is removed from the latent matrix, and the given prompt is used for guidance resulting in a more accurate image that is closer to the prompt. The decoder then converts the latent matrix to the final image. </p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image" style="max-width:1600pxpx"><div><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/640f56f76d313bbe39631bfd/64dd147c84411f6e7392307e_x3iLucKtE-LhQYGihZm2-mEENbOsCSxT38kx8_Oa3lUiWoEYetcuQHQ7JnlmLMaQT5hWYBOYJ_bXxtZ40Y0GumPZs-Iov6bzHldfdPDWLXk2kphfIWryx39JmGGrIDtnfdd4LMTHjY4pH6OfdojhTeU.jpeg"/></div></figure><p>Figure From <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-stable-diffusion/"><em>The Illustrated Stable Diffusion</em></a></p><p>The text description guides the diffusion process so the generated image matches the description.
