<p>In the last year, we have seen remarkable growth in the capability of open-source LLMs due to several factors, including the increasing availability of data, the development of new training techniques, and the growing demand for AI solutions. Their transparent, accessible, and customizable ability makes them a perfect alternative for closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the challenges with open-source LLMs is no agreed-upon evaluation criteria. It makes it difficult to compare and choose a model for a particular task. However, several benchmarking techniques have come forth, such as MMLU and ARC, to evaluate the performance of open-source LLMs on various tasks.</p><p>In this article, we will analyze different open-source LLMs to help you understand and choose a model for your needs.</p><h2 id="open-source-vs-closed-source-llms">Open Source Vs Closed Source LLMs</h2><p>With open-source LLMs (Large Language Models), individuals can build custom models tailored to specific tasks and domains. These models remove the entry barrier in AI. Organizations and researchers can train their LLMs, deploying them on personal PCs.&nbsp;</p><p>Businesses can use open-source LLMs to design models that securely reside on internal servers, evolving performance through continuous refinement and specialization. It grants businesses control, amplifying their AI efforts and internal capabilities.</p><p>The public availability and involvement in open-source LLMs promotes experimentation and innovation. Platforms like Hugging Face, facilitate the availability of pre-trained models and NLP tools to help people evaluate and work on their and other state-of-the-art models.</p><p>However, open-source LLMs are still not at par with closed-source LLMs like GPT-4. It is because closed-source LLMs can be trained on more data and with more computational resources. Despite their current limitations, they are likely to close the gap in their performance.</p><h2 id="exploring-the-architecture-of-llms">Exploring The Architecture Of LLMs</h2><p>LLMs use a transformer architecture consisting of a stack of neural networks trained to predict the next word in a sequence. Transformers are based on self-attention mechanisms, which allow the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence. It has a significant impact on a model’s performance and capabilities. Hence, understanding their architecture is essential for their efficient use.</p><h3 id="encoder-only">Encoder Only</h3><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:929px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="929px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/640f56f76d313bbe39631bfd/64d7c0bcb7acfdbdeef5fe97_hyjyQgsXIPQDTA9xGJNIwgjopH4co5Xm-W6dhvU0MGqT9sk3PUmb5c_FRiUfrkIhmSU78PvLlMjNte1vQyulolX9XldxpQRHX4Ra2MuZYuuOnca2N6I7SahpMuZUGRAFfhLX-4Rl294_xrFSKshsDbw.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>Figure from <a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/a-better-transformer-for-fast-transformer-encoder-inference/"><em>A BetterTransformer for Fast Transformer Inference</em></a></p><p>Encoder models are systems that use only the encoder of a Transformer model. Their attention layers access all words in the input sentence and use bidirectional context to make predictions. They pre-train with masked language modeling (MLM), which masks a portion of the input tokens and asks the model to predict them. It helps the model understand the context of words in a sentence. Fine-tuning the text representations is helpful for downstream tasks like classification, question answering, and named entity recognition. Some examples of encoder-only models include BERT and ELECTRA.</p><p>Encoder-only models are capable of learning long-range dependencies between words in a sentence. It helps understand the context of a sentence and make accurate predictions. They can represent sentence meanings in a vector space. It further aids the comparison of sentences and making predictions. They are efficient to train and deploy for large classification tasks. Hence, they are for sentence classification, named entity recognition, and extractive question answering.</p><h3 id="encoder-decoder">Encoder-Decoder</h3><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:1076px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="1076px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/640f56f76d313bbe39631bfd/64d7c0bccfc4c0f0e75c65a0_JN5AoMwpRmUaaPFxkfP3IzZJ2dZ1Jlda4aqidNwaMn4WfUk9H-6q0mBK2e0MQj6hcz_5ltKXo5Qu41dUULFUijbYzja556xiGHt_Iy2M_hj2klEomVTyEei_CpAYRynUabXTYrWkuHhuFyMY_NZ4Nog.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>Figure from <a href="https://d2l.ai/chapter_attention-mechanisms-and-transformers/transformer.html#encoder"><em>Dive Into Deep Learning</em></a></p><p>Encoder-decoder models are bidirectional models that pre-train on corrupted spans of text. The encoder generates the hidden representation as a summary of the input sequence. It is then passed to the decoder to generate the output. The advantage of having both the encoder and the decoder makes it effective against complex inputs. Span corruption helps the model to learn the context of words in a sentence, making it effective on tasks such as question answering, summarization, and translation. Some examples of encoder-decoder models are BART and Megatron.</p><p>Encoder-decoder models are mainly used for sequence-to-sequence predictions, such as text summarizations and question answering. It is capable of solving machine translation problems. These are good for generative tasks but are also computationally expensive. It is because it requires both an encoder and a decoder.

The architecture lacks an encoder. It implicitly encodes the information in the hidden state and updates it during output generation. They are pre-trained to predict the next word in a sentence, making them commonly used models for text generation. When fine-tuned, they can be used for downstream tasks by using a classifier over the last token hidden representation. Examples of decoder-only models include GPT models, transformer XL, and LLaMA.</p><p>Decoder-only models generate one word at a time. They take into account the context of already generated words to generate the next word. These models are for text generation purposes, including text completion, and question-answering.

They are capable of learning through feedback, thus, can improve over time.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="comparison-of-different-open-source-llms">Comparison Of Different Open-Source LLMs</h2><p>Here is an in-depth comparison of various open-source LLMs, focusing on their structures, training methods, and performance.</p><h3 id="llama">LLaMA</h3><h4 id="overview">Overview</h4><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971">LLaMA</a> is a family of large language models (LLMs) with a decoder-only architecture and bidirectional context. It was developed by Meta AI and released in February 2023. LLaMA models range in size from 7 billion to 65 billion parameters. LLaMA 1 models were trained on a dataset of 1.4 trillion tokens, while <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">Llama 2</a> models were trained on a dataset of 2 trillion tokens.&nbsp;</p><p>The latter was released in three model sizes: 7, 13, and 70 billion parameters. It also has some architectural tweaks, such as Grouped Query Attention to make inference more efficient. It uses a vanilla multi-head attention mechanism. But, it can be fine-tuned with reinforcement learning to improve its performance on specific tasks. It outperforms many LLMs like MPT but still lags behind GPT-4. It is a developing model that is effective in various tasks, such as machine translation, and code generation. It is perhaps the best open-source model in terms of capability out there right now.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:889px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="889px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/640f56f76d313bbe39631bfd/64d7c0bc6beb0efabb8dc778_y5cGPd6q24H8KDJ9JFL_JZU6rrBNlsdNnsg9qcn7aOTdz7BXPrftGfEhO0pkn7bLriXoYdG6ynnC7rSJeHzhgn8xAoAxDbI9znQ7f-I05IdP10B0jcB3fT3oY0HR3v_w7v1DFLsOnRqML1S5Mo3M1BI.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>Figure by <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/"><em>Meta AI</em></a></p><p>The Llama 1 license was for non-commercial use, while the Apache 2.0 license allows for commercial use with some restrictions. Meta forbids Llama 2’s usage to train other models. And if Llama 2 is used in an app or service with more than 700 million monthly users, a special license must be obtained from Meta AI. This means that the architecture can be studied and modified, and the code can be used to create new models. However, the weights of the model, which contain the learned parameters, are not publicly available. The <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-1T">RedPajama</a> project reproduces and distributes an open-source version of the LLaMA dataset.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/openlm-research/open_llama">OpenLLaMA</a> is an open-source reproduction of the LLaMA model. It provides researchers and developers an accessible and permissively licensed large language model. It is a 7B model trained on 200 billion tokens of the RedPajama dataset.

Consider the technical factors of an open-source LLM, such as model size, compute power and storage capacity. You might need to upgrade existing resources or consider cloud-based solutions. A model should be scalable to meet the real-world requirements of increasing demands. It is also necessary to consider the specific use case of the model. For example, a Falcon model may be good for language translation and automating repetitive work. If the business needs an LLM for both online and offline use, a Guanaco model may be a better option.</p><h3 id="integration-ability">Integration Ability</h3><p>Consider an open-source LLM that can integrate with your business systems. Check its compatibility with programming languages, frameworks, and APIs used in the ecosystem of your enterprise. It can save organizations time and effort and ensure the model works effectively. For example, Megatron-Turing NLG is a good option for enterprises using Python, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. It is also compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers library. It makes it easy to integrate into existing software applications.</p><h3 id="licensing">Licensing</h3><p>Businesses should understand the licensing terms of the open-source LLM they select. They must be clear about the license type, compatibility with other licenses, permitted usage, modifications, and distribution requirements. For example, Megatron-Turing NLG has a GPLv3 license. It allows the distribution of its modified version under the same license. But h2oGPT is under Apache 2.0 license. It permits modifications and commercial usage but forbids distribution under the same license. If you need a commercial license with no limitations, consider Falcon models. A brief review of the license guarantees alignment, IP respect, and legal compliance.</p><h3 id="adaptability">Adaptability</h3><p>The adaptability of an open-source LLM refers to its ability to perform various tasks and how accurate its output is for those tasks. This adaptability depends on the model's design, training data, documentation, and community. For example, Vicuna is adaptable in generating coherent creative content but lags in math. LLaMA, on the other hand, is accurate in common sense inference but average in the level of truthfulness in generating answers to questions. Also, MPT is a good model for long text generation due to its context length of 8K.</p><h2 id="the-advantages-of-open-source-llms">The Advantages Of Open Source LLMs</h2><p>Open-source LLMs offer several advantages over closed-source LLMs, including cost-effectiveness, flexibility, security, and reduced dependency on external providers.</p><h3 id="customization">Customization</h3><p>Open-source LLMs are a flexible alternative to proprietary LLMs. They are freely available to use and modify with no recurring costs. Organizations can deploy them on-premises and have more flexibility to customize the model to their needs. They can add specific features to open-source LLMs unavailable in the default version. Open-source LLMs have a large and active community of users and developers.
