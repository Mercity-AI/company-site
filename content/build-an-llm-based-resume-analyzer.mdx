<div class="rich-text w-richtext"><p>Today, most hiring processes don't begin with a human. They start with an Applicant Tracking System (ATS). Every resume gets scanned, compared against the job description, and ranked automatically. Only a small number ever make it to a recruiter’s desk.</p><p>While this system may seem efficient, it is fundamentally flawed. Traditional ATS systems work more like rigid keyword-matching machines. They often miss strong candidates with nuanced profiles, while pushing forward weaker ones who simply optimize for the right keywords. As a result, companies lose out on top talent before a human ever gets involved.</p><p>Modern hiring needs more than speed and scale. It needs a human-like understanding of context, intent, and real candidate capabilities, not just matching words on a page.</p><blockquote>💡💡 We built the LLM Based Resume Processing tool for you! Fully Open Source, Check it out <a href="https://github.com/Mercity-AI/Resume-Analyzer"><strong>here</strong></a></blockquote><blockquote>📻📻 And the video here:</blockquote><div class="w-embed w-iframe"><div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://www.loom.com/embed/3985f56862074443b058e705fc47590a?sid=a02fbd46-b4ee-43a2-bd85-a696ae6379c9" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" webkitallowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><h2 id="what-are-ats-systems">What are ATS Systems?</h2><p>An <strong>Applicant Tracking System (ATS)</strong> stores, organizes, and manages job applications, acting as the first layer of candidate filtering. It streamlines the shortlisting process by performing the following key steps:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>ATS Resume Parsing</strong></li></ul><p>The ATS breaks the resume into structured fields like name, contact info, work history, job titles, education, and skills. The goal is to convert the resume's content into a standardized, analyzable data format.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Keyword Matching</strong></li></ul><p>This is the most crucial step: matching the information against the job description.<br/>The system scans for specific keywords like job titles (e.g., “Backend Developer”), technical skills (e.g., “React,” “AWS”), certifications, and educational qualifications. It looks for exact word-to-word matches between what's on the resume and what's in the provided job post or criteria.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>ATS Scoring and Ranking</strong></li></ul><p>Once keyword matching is done, the ATS ranks resumes based on how well they align with the job description. Resumes with more keyword matches, relevant experience, and qualifications rank higher. Some systems even display a match score (e.g., "85% match"), with higher scores pushing resumes up the rankings.</p><h2 id="challenges-of-using-ats-systems">Challenges of using ATS systems </h2><p>ATS systems do help recruitment by handling scale and automating processes, but their flaws often outweigh the benefits, sometimes even hindering the hiring process. Here are the biggest issues with relying on them.</p><h3 id="parsing-failures-and-rigid-profiling">Parsing failures and rigid profiling</h3><p>Conventional ATS systems rely heavily on structured parsing, which can break when resumes use non-standard formats like complex templates or multi-column layouts. This often leads to important details like job titles, skills, or education being misclassified or lost.</p><p>These systems also expect traditional, linear career paths. Freelancers, startup founders, or candidates with career gaps or short-term roles are often ranked lower, simply because their experience doesn’t fit neatly into the rigid structure.</p><p>A major flaw is the over-reliance on exact keyword matching. If a job description mentions "JavaScript" but a resume lists "JS," the system often fails to make the connection. It struggles with synonyms, abbreviations, and variations.</p><h3 id="candidates-gaming-the-system">Candidates gaming the system</h3><p>The overreliance on keyword prioritization has led candidates to optimize their resumes to trick the system. Many overload their "Skills" section with job description keywords, or hide entire blocks of text from the job post in white text to fool the parser.</p><p>Some candidates use variations of job titles, even if they don’t hold those exact roles. For example, a "Software Engineer" might list "Developer" or "Programmer" to cover more job posts.</p><p>This keyword stuffing inflates ATS scores but doesn’t reflect actual skills. As a result, time is wasted on resumes that look perfect to the system but fail to deliver upon closer inspection. The core issue is that ATS can’t tell the difference between genuine expertise and keyword repetition.</p><h3 id="lack-of-contextual-understanding">Lack of contextual understanding</h3><p>ATS operate at a surface level, missing context, depth, and transferability. A candidate who managed a complex project but did not use exact buzzwords, may get overlooked. Career shifts, cross-functional skills, and project-based achievements often remain invisible. They also fail to assess qualities like initiative, ownership, or real-world impact.</p><p>Without reasoning abilities, ATS misses the nuances that predict job performance. For instance, they can’t infer that managing a "cloud migration project" implies experience with AWS/Azure, or that building a "Restful API in Node" suggests proficiency with JavaScript.</p><p>Language Models (LLMs) analyze resumes in a way that mirrors human understanding. They grasp the relationships between a candidate's achievements, skills, and experience, going beyond surface-level keyword matches. </p><p>By understanding context and intent, LLMs can recognize a candidate’s true potential. This leads to fairer, accurate, and more reliable candidate assessments.</p><h2 id="how-to-build-an-llm-based-resume-analyser">How to build an LLM based Resume analyser</h2><p>Instead of relying on keyword matching like traditional ATS systems, a smarter system can be built using a combination of LLMs. These models don’t just scan for terms, they understand context, connect achievements, and assess the depth of a candidate’s experience, much like a human would. Any general-purpose LLM can be paired with a reasoning-focused model to make this possible. In this case, GPT-4.1 works alongside o4-mini. Together, they deliver a far more accurate and meaningful evaluation of candidate potential.</p><p>Lets break it down</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image" style="max-width:1107pxpx"><div><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://blog-cdn.mercity.ai/blog/build-an-llm-based-resume-analyzer/681298661e0374406a836f21_AD_4nXdv_DuxwoChNQFvY1ikDayWbmLcKdpwzsON4Pgga9V7kJypGKDDreO0RSC9pBxf6NZvvyg4lYk8X3cqw5ETUrb0yf8taOviBTJ9uWAHFarWn1LHauVrY_mX8necExfVAjsv5K6JWg.png"/></div></figure><h3 id="job-description-analysis">Job Description Analysis </h3><p>The process starts with the recruiter providing the job description for the position. This job </p><p>description is then given to an LLM, in this case ‘gpt-4.1’, to analyse and break it down into three structured parts:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Must-Have Requirements</strong> </li></ul><p>These are<strong> ‘non-negotiable’ </strong>skills, qualifications, or experiences that a candidate must meet to be considered for the role.<br/>Example: 3+ years of backend development experience in Java.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Good-to-Have Requirements</strong></li></ul><p>These are additional skills or experiences that are<strong> ‘nice to have’</strong> and can strengthen a candidate's profile but are not mandatory.<br/>Example: Familiarity with AWS or Kubernetes.<br/><br/></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Additional Screening Criteria</strong></li></ul><p>These are specific conditions or constraints that can filter candidates based on eligibility, availability, or work policies.<br/>Example: Only candidates available for immediate joining; no remote work option.<br/><br/></p><p>The following prompt was used with gpt-41 for achieving the desired output.</p><div class="w-embed"><div style="background-color: #2A2A2B;padding: 2.5%;">
<code>

</code>
</div></div><p>This core prompt, along with telling the model to output in the shown below JSON schema creates our prompt.</p><p>The output is returned in JSON format with four sections: <em>original_job_description</em>, <em>must_have_requirements</em>, <em>good_to_have_requirements</em>, and <em>additional_screening_criteria</em>. Each section contains structured arrays extracted from the job description.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image" style="max-width:960pxpx"><div><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://blog-cdn.mercity.ai/blog/build-an-llm-based-resume-analyzer/68129330f96853508dbe169d_AD_4nXfBTsCY_XCeXaJx64SVB-jGwQLfVZzpWMBovEZ5OwMfV4yA12iL4IpFGXapuYivT21Mu3IIdKaDXpInk_PEWDnXlGantqg-DiV7lmT9mOe1r_F9jyRLsgammHDKtXRdaqqpG6rY.png"/></div></figure><p>The JSON output is structured, making it easier to process in the next steps. It helps the second LLM model better understand the job description compared to the original text format.</p><p>The whole process is split into two parts to make the most of each model’s strengths. GPT-4.1 focuses on the job description, breaking it down to clearly understand what the role needs. Then, o4-mini evaluates the candidate, using its reasoning to assess the fit and explain <em>why</em>. </p><h3 id="resume-analysis">Resume Analysis</h3><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image" style="max-width:1600px"><div><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://blog-cdn.mercity.ai/blog/build-an-llm-based-resume-analyzer/68129899c647b112762441ef_AD_4nXdXswwwyBeNgv_WmFegt_f0eqQ9jOu6TBT6E4hCggg0Y1DXyEMpnUnwN3xaPQNHg2WoRDX6zrEyTc3Jl7nGj28bYc0BkCKSrj-89LIkZ40MDJUSxqrENAdI5jIX9F2xK8eq4-e9.png"/></div></figure><p> This stage uses ‘o4-mini’, a reasoning model that excels at step-by-step thinking, making it ideal for multi-stage evaluation tasks. The LLM takes the output from the job description analyzer and the candidate's resumes as input, and assesses each candidate's fit against the job description.</p><p>To achieve this, a single prompt is broken into three distinct parts: <strong>quantitative evaluation, qualitative assessment, </strong>and <strong>final recommendation</strong>. This modular breakdown serves two purposes.</p><p>First, it aligns with how reasoning models work best, one step at a time, ensuring more accurate and consistent results. Second, it gives us greater control. If evaluation criteria change, each section can be updated independently without reworking the entire system. This structure keeps the logic clean, flexible, and easy to evolve as hiring needs grow.</p><h4 id="quantitative-check">Quantitative Check</h4><p>The first step is a quantitative evaluation of the candidate’s resume. This focuses on the non-negotiable, hard requirements of the job. For example, if the role needs 3+ years of Python and the candidate has only worked with Java, they miss a core requirement. This ensures we filter out mismatches early. It’s a strict check, not based on potential, but on clear criteria that must be met. This also allows the system to later focus on deeper insights and harder-to-measure qualities, such as softer skills. </p><p>Below is the prompt we use for Step 1.</p><div class="w-embed"><div style="background-color: #2A2A2B;padding: 2.5%;">
<code>
<i>
You are a recruiter evaluating a candidate's resume against a given job description (JD). Based on the JD, evaluate whether the candidate meets the necessary requirements.<br/><br/>
Step 1: Quantitative Check<br/>
Perform a Boolean (true/false) check for each requirement based on the candidate's resume:<br/><br/>

-For each skill listed in must_have_requirements and good_to_have_requirements, determine if the candidate possesses it. Return true or false for each.<br/>
-For each core_responsibility, determine if the candidate has demonstrated it in their past work. Return true or false.<br/>
-For each additional_screening_criteria, return a boolean value indicating whether the candidate meets the condition (e.g., full-time, onsite position, work authorization, etc.).<br/>
</i>
</code>
</div></div><p>Remember the JSON output from the Job Description Analyzer? In this step, o4-mini analyzes the candidate’s resume and checks each requirement from that output, providing a simple boolean <em>(true/false)</em> response for each one. </p><p>It looks something like this:</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image" style="max-width:717pxpx"><div><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://blog-cdn.mercity.ai/blog/build-an-llm-based-resume-analyzer/6812933116430104c5aaaddf_AD_4nXeB6f5r-PbQ8xP4kQmb4gw4Dn7d4yWc4IfXl7bGZo7ntiJw9HERoHEaGvD9YUeHxGR0xBt2w0LW7HAkBtGSwGQSSbwt3drm6Cn3uaGqgjgAxWJKSaWlg2ARoNSyGX_OKdZBqGwOrw.png"/></div></figure><p>This example shows the boolean evaluation for <em>must_have_requirements</em>. Similar true/false responses are also generated for <em>good_to_have_requirements</em> and <em>additional_screening_criteria</em>.</p><h4 id="qualitative-check">Qualitative Check </h4><p>The next step is the qualitative analysis of the candidate’s resume. This is where human-like understanding and holistic evaluation come in. We’re testing the candidate's inferred skills, the real-world impact of their projects, their level of ownership and initiative, and how transferable their experience is to the role. <em>Here, we are reading between the lines to understand soft skills, the practical impact of their work, and to extract abilities that aren’t just explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from their experience. </em></p><p>This is where the real magic of the LLM happens, because it mirrors human evaluation, helping us judge the true potential and fit of a candidate. </p><p>This is the part of the prompt that achieves the qualitative analysis in Step 2</p><div class="w-embed"><div style="background-color: #2A2A2B;padding: 2.5%;">
<code>
<i>

Step 2: Qualitative Assessment<br/>
Now, switch to a recruiter-style qualitative assessment. Use your intuition like a human — go beyond what's explicitly stated. Read between the lines, infer intent, and use contextual clues from the resume and the JD to judge fit. Reference the results from Step 1 as part of your reasoning.<br/><br/>
Assess the following:<br/>
<br/>
-Inferred Skills: What skills can you infer from the candidate's projects or roles?<br/>
-Project Gravity: Were the projects academic or real-world, high-impact, production-ready, etc.?<br/>
-Ownership and Initiative: Did the candidate lead the work? Show initiative? Or just follow directions?<br/>
-Transferability to Role: How well would their experience transfer to this particular role? Will they onboard quickly?<br/>
-Bonus Experience &amp; Extra Qualifications: If the JD lists any bonus criteria (e.g., fintech, B2B SaaS), consider that a positive signal even if not part of Step 1.<br/>
-Recruiter Style Summary: Provide a recruiter style summary of the full profile of the candidate, consider the results of both the quantitative and qualitative assessment.<br/>
</i>
</code>
</div></div><p>Here, the result is again a JSON object, which includes the inferred skills from the candidate’s projects, the <strong>project gravity </strong>(assessing the quality, difficulty, and real-world impact of their work), the<strong> level of ownership and leadership</strong> initiative shown, and a direct evaluation of <strong>transferability</strong> that is, how well the candidate’s skills and experience fit the requirements of the role</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image" style="max-width:742pxpx"><div><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://blog-cdn.mercity.ai/blog/build-an-llm-based-resume-analyzer/68129331edf6bd05963f1f27_AD_4nXeInAYODussmCBSEaIFIisTlGugQVTf5OC68lPhP4PaaCQTYpyF02qoDOLPHir2BPNLafvhP6zbJ04zjtwSMOvH2LxsPN8o654Rry00yrHP5aVCctJmGPkCpr-GCeT-X8aWUqVgIw.png"/></div></figure><p>This kind of human-like qualitative assessment is impossible with a traditional ATS system. Our method goes beyond basic keyword matching by considering all the important factors that truly affect a candidate’s quality. An ATS would never be able to assess project gravity, real-world impact, or skill transferability. </p><p>It would treat a Python project on a simple IRIS dataset the same as a complex Django backend system,  giving them equal weight even though the difficulty and relevance are completely different. By automating these deeper qualitative checks, our system delivers much higher-quality results.</p><h3 id="final-recommendation">Final Recommendation</h3><p>This is the third and final step, where we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors to give a clear recommendation on whether the candidate should move forward. The output is a simple "<strong>Yes</strong>" or "<strong>No</strong>" based on a well-rounded evaluation. <br><br>Along with the final recommendation, it also provides the factors and reasoning behind the decision. The following prompt is used for Step 3  </br></br></p><div class="w-embed"><div style="background-color: #2A2A2B;padding: 2.5%;">

## Step 3: Final Recommendation <br/>
After both steps, make a final call. Output "Yes" or "No" and summarize your reasoning concisely.
