As AI systems become more capable, ensuring they remain aligned with human values becomes increasingly critical. This paper presents a formal framework for understanding the fundamental limits of alignment.

## Defining Alignment Mathematically

We formalize alignment as a constrained optimization problem:

> Maximize utility U(π) subject to safety constraints S(π) ≥ threshold

Where π represents the policy, U is the utility function learned from human preferences, and S encodes safety boundaries.

## The Goodhart Problem

A key challenge emerges: any proxy metric we optimize will eventually diverge from our true intent. We prove that this divergence is bounded under certain conditions:

1. **Bounded rationality** of the reward model
2. **Distributional shift** constraints
3. **Corrigibility** requirements

## RLHF Limitations

Our analysis reveals fundamental limitations in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback:

- Human feedback is inherently noisy and inconsistent
- Preference models compress complex values into scalar rewards
- Optimization pressure can exploit gaps in human oversight

## Proposed Framework

We introduce "Constrained Alignment Optimization" (CAO), which:

1. Maintains explicit uncertainty over human values
2. Implements conservative behavior under uncertainty
3. Allows for value learning and updating

## Conclusions

Perfect alignment may be theoretically impossible, but we can establish meaningful bounds on misalignment. This work provides the mathematical foundation for building safety guarantees into AI systems.
