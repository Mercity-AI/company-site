    # OPTIONAL: Clean URLs for Blog Posts
    # ========================================
    # This block is PURELY COSMETIC - it allows URLs like:
    #   /blog-post/neural-nets  (without .html extension)
    # instead of:
    #   /blog-post/neural-nets.html
    #
    # WITHOUT this block:
    #   - Blog posts still work perfectly
    #   - Just need to use .html in URLs
    #   - SEO and performance are identical
    #
    # WITH this block:
    #   - Cleaner URLs (no .html extension)
    #   - Same SEO and performance
    #
    # You can comment this out to test without it first!
    # ========================================
    location ~ ^/blog-post/(.+)$ {
        # Try to serve the file with .html extension first
        # Example: /blog-post/neural-nets → tries /blog-post/neural-nets.html
        try_files /blog-post/$1.html /blog-post/$1 =404;
    }

    # ========================================
    # Default SPA routing (REQUIRED)
    # ========================================
    # Serves static files if they exist (including our blog post .html files)
    # Falls back to index.html for SPA routes (/, /about, /blog)
    # This already works for blog posts even without the optional block above!
    # ========================================
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # ========================================
    # Cache static assets (Recommended for Performance)
